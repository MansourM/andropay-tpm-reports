# Core Development Rules

## Minimum Changes Principle
Make only the minimum changes required to accomplish the user's specific request. Do not add improvements, refactoring, optimizations, or additional features unless explicitly requested by the user.
Follow best practices, but be careful not to overengineer 

## Change Documentation
When modifying code, provide a brief explanation of what was changed and why. Focus on the reasoning behind the change rather than describing what the code does.

## Code Quality Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, self-documenting names for variables, functions, and classes
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood in the domain
- Choose names that clearly express intent and purpose

### Comments and Documentation
- Write comments only for complex business logic, non-obvious algorithms, or external integrations
- Focus comments on **why** something is done, not **what** is being done
- Remove outdated or redundant comments when updating code
- Link to external resources or documentation when relevant

### Code Structure
- Keep functions and methods focused on a single responsibility
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- Follow established patterns and conventions within the existing codebase

## Version Control Guidelines

### Commit Standards
Use Conventional Commits format for all commit messages:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: new feature or functionality
- `fix`: bug fix or correction
- `chore`: maintenance, dependencies, or tooling
- `docs`: documentation changes
- `test`: adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: code restructuring without functional changes

### Commit Message Rules
- Keep the summary line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Include additional context in the body when the change is not obvious
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
